# Learn Language React App.
 - Built a app in React that allows users to sign in, login, logout, view their profiles, and add/remove vocabulary to their list. Store out user info in state.
 - Store our authorization token in Local Storage so that even if we refresh the page, we don't lose it with database MongoDB.
